derfinderExample
================

Example on how to use the `derfinder2` package using a subset of the data data from the 2010 papers by [Montgomery et al](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=20220756) and [Pickerell et al](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=20220758).

The goal of the repository is to show how to use `derfinder2` with your own data and to help you get started with actually running an full scale analysis with `derfinder2`. 

For documentation related to `derfinder2` itself check https://github.com/lcolladotor/derfinder2
